# Data sharing overview

The agent shares metadata and logs with `hercules-ci.com` to populate the dashboard and distribute work to other agents. It does not upload sources, whole derivations, or build outputs. This way it's easy to keep your software confidential.

`hercules-ci.com` will receive the following information.

Per agent:

 * hostname
 * agent version
 * nix version
 * systemFeatures
 * push cache configuration (excluding secrets)
 * substituter urls (e.g. `s3://our-nix-cache?profile=cache-pull&region=us-east-1`)

Per evaluation:

 * attribute names
 * error messages from Nix
 * derivation metadata
 ** drv path name (e.g. `/nix/store/...-name.drv`)
 ** output path names
 ** platform
 ** requiredSystemFeatures (e.g. `nixos-test`, `kvm`)
 ** dependencies (paths, output names)
 ** source path names (no contents)

Per build (realisation):

 * build log at a verbose level
 * derivation path
 * output hashes as in `nix-store -q --hash`
 * output sizes as in `nix-store -q --size`
 * timestamps
