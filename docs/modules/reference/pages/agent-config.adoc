= Configuration file

When deploying with NixOS, NixOps or nix-darwin you should use the module
documentation instead, or skip ahead to read about less frequently used options
to use with `extraOptions`.

The configuration format for the agent is https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#toml[TOML] markup.
Its location can be specified by invoking `hercules-ci-agent --config agent.toml`. Alternatively, the NixOS and nix-darwin module can generate this file for you. See also xref:ROOT:getting-started/index.adoc#deploy-agent[the setup guide].

A basic `agent.toml` looks as follows:

[source,toml]
----
include::reference:partial$agent-small-example.toml[]
----

NOTE: If you are deploying an agent, the xref:ROOT:getting-started/index.adoc[guide] is a better starting point.

[[apiBaseUrl]]
== apiBaseUrl

Optional. Defaults to `https://hercules-ci.com[https://hercules-ci.com]`.

HTTP API agent will connect to.

[[baseDirectory]]
== baseDirectory

Required.

Directory with all the agent state: secrets, work, etc.

[[binaryCachesPath]]
== binaryCachesPath

Optional. Defaults to `<<staticSecretsDirectory,_staticSecretsDirectory_>>/binary-caches.json` if that file exists. With the NixOS module this defaults to `/var/lib/hercules-ci-agent/secrets/binary-caches.json`.

Path to a JSON file containing binary cache secret keys.

The contents of the file are described in xref:binary-caches-json.adoc[binary-caches.json].

[[clusterJoinTokenPath]]
== clusterJoinTokenPath

Optional. Defaults to `<<staticSecretsDirectory,_staticSecretsDirectory_>>/cluster-join-token.key`.

Path to a secret token retrieved when creating a new agent via
https://hercules-ci.com/dashboard.

This token is used for authentication with `<<apiBaseUrl,_apiBaseUrl_>>`.

[[concurrentTasks]]
== concurrentTasks

Optional. Defaults to 4.

Combined number of workers to use for building and evaluating Nix derivations.

The optimal value depends on the resource consumption characteristics of your workload,
including memory usage and in-task parallelism. This is typically determined empirically.

[[staticSecretsDirectory]]
== staticSecretsDirectory

Optional. Defaults to `<<baseDirectory,_baseDirectory_>>/secrets`.

This is the default directory to look for statically configured secrets like
clusterJoinTokenPath.

[[workDirectory]]
== workDirectory

Optional. Defaults to `<<baseDirectory,_baseDirectory_>>/work`.

The directory in which temporary subdirectories are created for task state.
This includes sources for Nix evaluation.
