# Upgrade to hercules-ci-agent 0.9

0.9 introduces a few changes to improve usability and security.

This includes a few incompatibilities with prior releases. We've kept these to
a minimum and you can have a smooth upgrade by following these steps.

## Update the agent

### Prepare `secrets.json`

You can skip this step if your `secrets.json` is empty: `{ }`

Most significant is the addition of a xref:hercules-ci-agent:ROOT:secrets-json.adoc#condition[`condition`] field in `secrets.json`.
Lack of a `condition` makes a secret inaccessible, to be secure by default.

The following snippet will generate a template for filling in these `condition` fields. You'll want to replace `your-github-org` but leave `enter repo here`, as you must replace those manually in the next step.

```console
nix-shell -p jq
jq <secrets.json 'map_values(. + {"condition": {"or": [{"and": ["isDefaultBranch", {"isOwner": "your-github-org"}, {"isRepo": "enter repo here"}]}]}})'
```

The `"or"` node is technically redundant, but comes in handy when a secret must be used in multiple scenarios. The `"and"` describes each situation and the `"or"` allows each independently.

For each secret, you can review which repositories and branches should be allowed to access them. The default branch is typically `main`, `master` or `develop`. You can specify a different branch with xref:hercules-ci-agent:ROOT:secrets-json.adoc#condition[`isBranch`]. You can remove the branch restrictions by removing branch-related nodes.

This may also be a good time to enable https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches[GitHub branch protection], to enforce checks and reviews of your privileged branches. Repo admins can find this under each GitHub's repo btn:[Settings] tab -> btn:[Branches] menu item.

### Update your agents

How to update your agents depends on the installation method you've used.

As of writing you need to use a git revision from `master`. A release to `nixos-unstable` is currently blocked on a Haskell GHC major upgrade.

xref:hercules-ci:ROOT:guides/update-agent-using-flake.adoc[This guide] describes how to update to a flake-provided version, but come back to this guides for updates to the repositories.

### Upgrade your repositories

The agent will now prioritize `flake.nix` over `default.nix`. When a `ci.nix` or `nix/ci.nix` is present, it will be picked up just like before. If your repository contains both a `flake.nix` and a CI configuration in `default.nix`, you can put `import ./default.nix` in `ci.nix` or upgrade to the flake-based format.

Regardless of file choice, you can now configure your Hercules CI jobs using the new xref:hercules-ci-agent:ROOT:evaluation.adoc[`herculesCI` attribute].

Flakes have the additional benefit of a default `onPush` job based on well-known flake attributes. Please compare the attributes list in the https://hercules-ci.com/dashboard[dashboard]. 

```nix
outputs = { ... }: flake-utils.xyz (
  # ...
)
// { # make sure to set a top-level outputs attribute

  # restrict which systems to build in CI
  herculesCI.ciSystems = ["x86_64-linux"];
}
```

If something is missing, or if you want to make use of some new features, you can define your own `herculesCI.onPush` attributes using the xref:hercules-ci-agent:ROOT:evaluation.adoc[documented schema].

#### Upgrade from `flake-compat-ci`

If your repository was using the `flake-compat-ci` flake, similar to the https://github.com/NixOS/templates/tree/4396ff1aec6e7c2828257bc21496f336a8c09358/hercules-ci[old template] you can do the following:

 - Remove `ci.nix`
 - Remove `flake-compat.nix`
 - Open `flake.nix`
   * Remove `inputs.flake-compat-ci`
   * Remove `inputs.flake-compat` (unless you have a reason to keep it)
   * Remove the corresponding parameters in `outputs`
   * Remove the `ciNix` output

Note that changes to the lockfile may cause unrelated changes.

If an attribute is missing or if you're having any other kind of trouble, contact @roberthensing in the Nix Flakes matrix room, or email `support@hercules-ci.com`.
