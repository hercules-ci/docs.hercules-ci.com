= Effects Introduction

Beyond building the software, it is useful to effect change "in the real world". 
Steps like deployment have characteristics that Nix's derivations are not intended for.
To support tasks like these, Hercules CI provides an Effects feature, which lets
you write Nix expressions that specify what to do when the build succeeds.

[[reproducible-deployments]]
== Reproducible Deployments

Effects are designed to provide an hermetic environment for your deployments.
You can think of it as a better `nix-shell` or `nix develop`, something between
a shell and the Nix build sandbox.

The effects sandbox gives access to:

* the Nix store, without the restrictions of the Nix build sandbox
* the network
* locally configured secrets
* the Hercules CI state files API

Secrets are configured locally on your agent machines, so you don't have to
entrust us with your cloud credentials.

[[nix-build-optional]]
== `nix-build` Now Optional

Because Effects are written with in the same language as your builds, you
can transparently use anything you've built in your deployments.

Here's the crux of a remote hello world with the xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:index.adoc[`hercules-ci-effects`] library.

```nix
mkEffect {
  effectScript = ''
    echo "Hello from effect sandbox"
    ${effects.ssh { destination = "some-host"; } ''
      ${pkgs.hello}/bin/hello
    ''}
  '';
}
```

If you do need to run dynamic builds from within an effect, that also just works.
So all tools like NixOps, Colmena, etc, can run in effects.

[[state-files-and-locking]]
== State and Locking API

The Hercules CI API provides a convenient way to store deployment information.
Think of it as a bucket of files for each of your repositories, with the same 
permissions and a preserved history.

For example, with NixOps 2 (upcoming release), you can safely collaborate
on deployments with minimal configuration.
The Hercules CI API then serves as a simple alternative to, say, S3 buckets
that you would have to bootstrap manually.

You can use state files and locks using the xref:hercules-ci-agent:hci:index.adoc[`hci` command] State files can be accessed through the
dashboard in your project's btn:[State] tab, through the `hci state` command, or with the
link:++https://hercules-ci.com/api/v1/#/default/get_api_v1_projects__projectId__state__stateName__data++[API].

[[sequential-and-concurrent-execution]]
== Sequential and Concurrent Execution

Effects only run after the whole build was successful and after all preceding jobs'
effects have completed, so you don't have to worry about concurrent mutation of
shared resources in any single effect.

If your job has multiple effects, those will run concurrently, but only with
those in the same job.

Contention is low, because only the effectful part of your deployment
is mutually exclusive.

== Current limitations

* Currently, effects are https://github.com/hercules-ci/hercules-ci-agent/issues/271[not supported] on macOS (darwin).
* State files do not come with a https://github.com/hercules-ci/hercules-ci-agent/issues/272[built-in/standard encryption method] yet.
