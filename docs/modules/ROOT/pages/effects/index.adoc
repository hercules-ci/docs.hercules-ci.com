= Effects

Beyond building the software, it is useful to effect change "in the real world". 
Steps like deployment have characteristics that Nix's derivations are not intended for.
To support tasks like these, Hercules CI provides an Effects feature, which lets
you write Nix expressions that specify what to do when the build succeeds.

Effects do run in a custom sandbox that, unlike normal derivations, gives access
to:

* the Nix store, without the restrictions of the Nix build sandbox
* the network
* locally configured secrets
* the Hercules CI state files API

Secrets are configured locally on your agent machines, so you don't have to
entrust us with your cloud credentials.

The Hercules CI state file API helps with preserving essential information from
one effect run to the next. For example, it can be used for the NixOps state or
maintaining the SSH `known_hosts`. State files can be accessed through the
dashboard in your project's btn:[State] tab, through the `hci state` command, or with the
link:++https://hercules-ci.com/api/v1/#/default/get_api_v1_projects__projectId__state__stateName__data++[API].

== Limitations

* Currently, effects are https://github.com/hercules-ci/hercules-ci-agent/issues/271[not supported] on macOS (darwin).
* State files do not come with a https://github.com/hercules-ci/hercules-ci-agent/issues/272[built-in/standard encryption method] yet.

== Continue

* Deploy a NixOS machine with `hercules-ci-effects`
* Deploy a NixOps network with `hercules-ci-effects`
* Write a custom effect
