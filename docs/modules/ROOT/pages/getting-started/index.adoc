= Getting Started

The setup can be performed by following the steps on https://hercules-ci.com[hercules-ci.com]
instead.

You may either follow this guide step by step, or use parts of it as reference for the setup process.

[[github]]
== Step 1. GitHub

 1. Click btn:[Sign in] on the top right of https://hercules-ci.com/dashboard[hercules-ci.com] and follow the steps.

 2. Click btn:[Add GitHub repositories, organizations] near the top of the https://hercules-ci.com/dashboard[dashboard].

 3. GitHub will give you a choice to install the application on all repositories,
    which includes repositories to be created in the future, or to select specific
    repositories. We recommend that you make a selection of repositories, assuming
    not all your repositories have suitable Nix expressions. Follow the steps.

NOTE: Hercules CI will automatically pick up permissions from GitHub. Collaborators will find the repositories they have access to when they sign in.

[#deploy-agent]
== Step 2. Deploy an Agent

To start building you need to deploy an agent first.

The agent adds itself to a cluster by means of a _cluster join token_.
This token corresponds to a GitHub user or organization.
The same token may be used to add multiple agents.

[WARNING]
====
When updating the cluster join token on a previously deployed agent, remove the `/var/lib/hercules-ci-agent/secretState/session.key` file and restart the agent.
This is resolved in hercules-ci-agent 0.3.1 or later.
====

Choose one of the deployment options:

- xref:getting-started/deploy/terraform.adoc[Deploy with Terraform], for a wide range of cloud support
- xref:getting-started/deploy/nixops.adoc[Deploy with NixOps], for provisioning NixOS machines
- xref:getting-started/deploy/nixos.adoc[Deploy with NixOS], for existing machines or custom deployment tools
- xref:getting-started/deploy/nix-darwin.adoc[Deploy with nix-darwin], the recommended configuration management tool for macOS
- xref:getting-started/deploy/manual.adoc[Install manually], when the other methods are not suitable
