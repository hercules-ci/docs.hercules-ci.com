# Remote deployment with NixOS

## Basic method

You can set up an agent on a remote NixOS machine by following the same NixOS instructions via an SSH connection.


## Scriptable

Instead of deploying with Terraform, or NixOps with `deployment.targetEnv = "none"`, you could script the deployment yourself.

`nixos-rebuild` has a `--target-host` option to make deployment via SSH easier. Evaluation of the NixOS configuration will happen on your local machine, but build and activation are performed via SSH.

```shell
[user@workstation:~/my-agent]$ NIXOS_CONFIG=$PWD/configuration.nix nixos-rebuild --target-host my-agent
```

Note that this determines the NixOS version via `NIX_PATH`, which defaults to a channel on `workstation`.

Updating the secret files is still a manual operation.
