= Repository Setup

Hercules CI is configured "by convention" using `.nix` files in your repository.
Follow these steps to ensure a correct setup.

// TODO: split this into an actual troubleshooting document and an advanced project setup tutorial

1. Clone your repository

2. Choose which Nix file to use for CI
+
Reuse `/default.nix`::
For simple projects that only need to build for a single architecture and a single set of dependencies.
or create a `/ci.nix` or `/nix/ci.nix`::
For projects that need to build for multiple architectures or versions, or where `default.nix` already
has a special meaning that conflicts with the need for CI.

3. Use pinned dependencies instead of `<nixpkgs>` or similar.
+
Hercules CI uses an empty `NIX_PATH` to help with evaluation reproducibility.
+
The unofficial NixOS wiki has https://nixos.wiki/wiki/FAQ/Pinning_Nixpkgs[a basic method of pinning Nixpkgs].
+
You can use an impure evaluation-time fetcher such as `builtins.fetchUrl`, although this typically makes your evaluation unreproducible.

4. Optionally, test locally with `nix-instantiate`
+
The behavior of `nix-instantiate` serves as a reference for evaluation in Hercules CI.
You may use the following command to test locally:
+
[source,bash]
----
NIX_PATH="" nix-instantiate nix/ci.nix
----
+
This may produce a lot of output if you are using import from derivation. You may run it twice for clarity.

5. Commit and push

6. Check the attributes via the GitHub commit status or the https://hercules-ci.com/dashboard[dashboard]. If necessary, see
