Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers.
To facilitate deployment with this tool, we provide terraform modules.

If you already have a workflow for terraform deployments, the https://github.com/hercules-ci/terraform-hercules-ci#readme[terraform modules] are your starting point.

If you are using AWS and/or this is your first terraform deployment, we provide an https://github.com/hercules-ci/example-deploy-agent-terraform-aws#readme[AWS example deployment project] that you can adapt.
